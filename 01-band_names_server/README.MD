# BAND NAMES

It's a Node.js application, it's based on band voting. You can make actions like add a new band, remove a band and obviously vote for a band. All the traffic is managed in real time with socket.io.

There is a web basic version if you want to [take a look](https://socket-bands.herokuapp.com/). Open the developer tools in the "console" tab and check the count of voting.

If you want to check the [flutter application](../01-band_names_server).
